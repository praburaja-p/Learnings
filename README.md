Angular 2 vs. Angular 1
------------------------
* Angular 2 is quite different from its predecessor. It is component-based, and the use of controllers and scope has been deprecated. Syntax and structure have also changed.
* It is faster than its predecessor. As said in ng-conf it is 2 to 5 times better than Angular 1.
* It took a mobile-first approach.
* Changed structure and syntax. It is simpler in structure. The component structure makes it easy to use.
* Changed dependency injection.
* More Language choices, i.e you can use Typescript, Dart, or JavaScript for your implementation.
* Difficult to set up. In Angular, you just have to add the reference of the library but in Angular 2 you have to set different node modules to make it work.
